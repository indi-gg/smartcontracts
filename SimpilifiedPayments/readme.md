# SimplifiedPayment Contract Documentation

## Overview
SimplifiedPayment is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates bulk payments in KCash and USDT tokens. It implements a role-based access control system for secure administration and includes treasury management functionality. The contract allows authorized administrators to disburse tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction.

## Key Features
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Bulk token distribution capabilities
- Support for both KCash and USDT tokens
- Flexible treasury management
- Event emission for payment tracking

## Contract Architecture

### Dependencies
- `AccessControl`: OpenZeppelin contract for role-based access management
- `IERC20`: Standard ERC20 interface
- `IKCash`: Custom interface for KCash token

### State Variables
- `ANDMIN_TRANSFER_ROLE`: Role identifier for transfer permissions
- `kcash`: Interface to interact with KCash token
- `usdt`: Interface for USDT token
- `treasuryType`: Determines the reward type for KCash transfers (1, 2, or 3)
- `treasury`: Address of the treasury wallet

## Core Functions

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor(address _kcash, address _usdt, address _owner, address _treasury, uint8 _treasuryType)
```
Initializes the contract with KCash and USDT addresses, owner, treasury address, and treasury type.

### Administrative Functions

```solidity
updateKcash(address _kcash)
```
Updates the KCash token contract address.

```solidity
updateUsdt(address _usdt)
```
Updates the USDT token contract address.

```solidity
updateTreasury(address _treasury)
```
Updates the treasury wallet address.

```solidity
updateTreasuryType(uint8 _treasuryType)
```
Updates the treasury type for KCash transfers.

### Withdrawal Functions
```solidity
withdrawKcash()
```
Allows admin to withdraw all KCash tokens.

```solidity
withdrawUsdt()
```
Allows admin to withdraw all USDT tokens.

```solidity
withdrawNativeBalance()
```
Allows admin to withdraw native currency balance.

### Deposit Functions
```solidity
addReward3(uint256 _amount)
```
Adds KCash tokens to the contract's Reward3 bucket.

```solidity
addUsdt(uint256 _amount)
```
Adds USDT tokens to the contract.

### Bulk Payment Functions
```solidity
bulkDisburseKCash(address[] _to, uint256[] _amounts, string _entityName, uint256 _totalAmount)
```
Executes bulk KCash transfers:
- Transfers tokens from treasury to contract
- Distributes to multiple recipients based on treasury type
- Emits payment event

```solidity
bulkDiburseUSDT(address[] _to, uint256[] _amounts, string _entityName, uint256 _totalAmount)
```
Executes bulk USDT transfers:
- Transfers tokens from treasury to contract
- Distributes to multiple recipients
- Emits payment event

## Events
```solidity
event KCashPayment(string entityName, uint256 totalAmount)
```
Emitted for bulk KCash payments.

```solidity
event USDTPayment(string entityName, uint256 totalAmount)
```
Emitted for bulk USDT payments.

## Security Considerations
1. Role-based access control for administrative functions
2. Array length validation in bulk transfer functions
3. Treasury type validation for KCash transfers
